SecureDrop Community Code of Conduct
================================================================================

Preamble:

Like the broader technical and activism communities as a whole, the SecureDrop
team is made up of a mixture of staff and volunteers from all over the world,
working on every aspect of our mission—including operations, software
development, mentorship, and building connections with great people and
organizations.

To work together effectively in a large, diverse and open community, we have a
few ground rules that we expect everyone to adhere to, be it paid staff and
board members, volunteers and event attendees; mentors, veterans, novices, or
those seeking help and guidance.

This isn't an exhaustive list of things that you cannot do. Rather, take it in
the spirit in which it’s intended: a guide to make it easier to enrich all of
us and the communities in which we participate.

This code of conduct applies to all spaces and events associated with
SecureDrop. This includes physical offices, GitHub repositories, online chat
systems, the Support Forum, SecureDrop hosted or sponsored events, and any other
forums created by the SecureDrop community which our team uses for communication.
In addition, we take violations of this code outside these spaces into account
when determining a person's ability to participate within them.

================================================================================
Summary
================================================================================

The SecureDrop community should be a place where people feel safe and welcome.
They should enjoy participating in discussions and contributing. To these ends,
members of the community should:

    Be friendly and patient

    Assume good faith and good intentions

    Be welcoming, considerate, and respectful

    Be careful in the words they choose

    Listen to each other, and communicate openly and honestly

Members of the community should not:

    Intimidate, harass, or insult each other

    Follow the letter of this Code of Conduct while disregarding its spirit

Members of the community should not hesitate to contact the Community Council if
they feel someone has violated this Code of Conduct, or if they have questions
or concerns.

Behavioral Guidelines
================================================================================

As a member of the community, you are expected to:

- Be friendly and patient. Your work will be used by other people, and you in
  turn will depend on the work of others. Any decision you take will affect
  human beings, and you should take those consequences into account when making
  decisions. Remember that our community is international, and that the people
  you interact with may be communicating with you in a language that is not
  their native tongue.

- Assume good faith and good intentions. Disagreements — both social and
  technical — happen all the time. Our diverse backgrounds give us the ability
  to see things from many different perspectives, but they can also lead to
  misunderstandings. It is important that we resolve disagreements
  constructively, and that we do not jump to conclusions about each other's
  motives.

- Be welcoming, considerate, and respectful. We strive to be a community that
  welcomes and supports people of all backgrounds and identities. This includes,
  but is not limited to, members of any race, ethnicity, culture, national
  origin, color, immigration status, social and economic class, educational
  level, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity and expression, age, size,
  family status, political belief, religion and mental and physical ability.

- Be careful in the words you choose. Exclusionary behavior is absolutely
  unacceptable. This includes, but is not limited to:

  - Discriminatory (e.g., racist or sexist) jokes and language
  - Inappropriate names for user accounts, servers, files, repositories, etc.
  - Posting sexually explicit or violent material
  - Personal insults
  - Misgendering or deadnaming
  - Unwelcome sexual attention
  - Advocating for, or encouraging, any of the above behavior

- Listen and communicate openly and honestly. Yield the floor to
  others, and help to make sure that everyone gets heard. In other words, try to
  be your best self. In doing so, you contribute the health and longevity of
  this community.

As a member of the SecureDrop community, you are expected to never engage in the
following behaviors:

- Intimidation, harassments, or insults.  This includes but is not limited to:
  - Physical intimidation or threats against someone's physical safety
  - Obscene or intimidating gestures
  - Stalking
  - Demeaning another person
  - Unwelcome following
  - Enlisting the help of others, whether in person or online, in order to
    target an individual
  - Taking photographs, video, or audio recordings or recordings without consent
  - Shouting
  - Sustained disruption of talks and events
  - Disruption of meetings
  - Inappropriate physical contact
  - Unwelcome sexual attention
  - Posting (or threatening to post) other people's personally identifying
    information ("doxing")
  - Respect people's stated personal boundaries

- Following the letter of this Code of Conduct while disregarding its spirit.
  When judging whether certain behavior represents a violation of this code, we
  will consider a violation in spirit (e.g., clearly behaving in a damaging or
  obnoxious manner in a way not explicitly specified) to be no different from
  any other violation of this code. That includes trolling and other forms of
  consistently disruptive behavior.
